<p class="limit" id="upperLeft_text" > It all starts with a dream, a passion, a hobby. You may like painting, like this girl, or even singing, maybe dancing. What your passion is, is not important. What matters is how you choose to pursue it. Are you talented enough? Or do you choose to paint for fun and that's it?</p>

Slash your canvas like your cutting every great artist that's ever come before you. Cut them down, knock them down a peg, show them that you are just as worthy as they are.</p>
