var FC00= "In 'How to Fall in Love' we follow 3 main protagonists as we examine Sternbergs Triangular Theory of Love. It is narrated over by a robotic and unsettling voice as weird imagery matches the topics discussed. It's a fun film, but yet takes itself seriously at times when i'ts needed, it's main goal is to make you go 'huh?'";
	
var FC02= "Sternbergs Triangular Theory of Love tackles the stages a couple moves through if not given all the proper components such as passion, commitment, and intimacy. We explore how without one or many of these components the relationship will fail to reach consummate love."

var FC03= "Through unsettling visuals and confusing elements, in this film, the complexity of love and what comes with it is explored. For example, you may gain your partner through eye contact ie the eyes on her face. This is also shown through lipstick being smeared on her face to represent physical attraction, and smiling where she smiles wholeheartedly with lipstick on her teeth."
